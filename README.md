# INFILTRAITOR

> Mobile turn-based stealth tactics game  
> **Engine:** Godot 4 · **Rendering:** Isometric 2.5D · **Platform:** iOS / Android / HTML5

## Overview

INFILTRAITOR is a turn-based stealth tactics game in the style of XCOM, with a Zelda-like room-to-room dungeon flow.

- **2 AP per turn** tactical movement
- **Portrait orientation**, camera follows the agent
- **Procedural dungeon generation** from handcrafted room templates
- **Isometric 2.5D** — dimetric projection (45° horizontal, 26.57° elevation), square tile grid via Godot `TileMap`

Visual direction: pre-rendered isometric 3D sprites (Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom / StarCraft), readable tactical overlays (XCOM 2).

## Project status

**Alpha 0** — first visual prototype running in-engine. 9×9 isometric room rendering with 240-tile TileSet. Agent movement and turn manager not yet implemented.

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| M0 — Design & asset organization | ✅ Complete |
| M1 — Godot prototype (one room, movement) | 🔄 In Progress |
| M1.5 — Tactical UI (tap-to-select, path preview) | |
| M2 — Threats & combat (guards, detection) | |
| M3 — Procedural floor builder | |
| M4 — Vertical slice | |
| M5 — Monetisation | |
| M6 — Content expansion | |
| M7 — Polish & launch | |

### Alpha 0 — what's working (2026-05-19)

- Godot 4.6 project scaffold (portrait 390×844, Mobile renderer)
- 240-tile isometric TileSet generated from `blocks-prototype` pack
- Custom data per tile: `tile_name`, `walkable`, `cover`, `interactive`
- 9×9 test room rendered from name-based tile placement (`room.gd`)
- TileRegistry: name → source_id lookup (auto-generated)
- VS Code dev workflow: **F5** launches the game, **⌘⇧B** rebuilds the TileSet

### Next up (M1 remainder)

- Agent placeholder on the grid (tap to move)
- 2 AP per turn system + turn manager
- Entrance / exit rooms and room transitions

## Asset structure

```
ASSETS/
├── ISOMETRIC/          ← 8 Kenney isometric packs (blocks, terrain, city, etc.)
├── CHARACTERS/humans/  ← 8 character variants × Idle / Run / Pickup animations
