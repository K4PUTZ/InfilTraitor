## Overview

INFILTRAITOR is a turn-based stealth tactics game in the style of XCOM, with a Zelda-like room-to-room dungeon flow.

- **2 AP per turn** tactical movement
- **Portrait orientation**, camera follows the agent
- **Procedural dungeon generation** from handcrafted room templates
- **Isometric 2.5D** — dimetric projection (45° horizontal, 26.57° elevation), square tile grid via Godot `TileMap`

Visual direction: pre-rendered isometric 3D sprites (Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom / StarCraft), readable tactical overlays (XCOM 2).
